        The crowd are cool but don't follow them. Follow your values - on this site and in your soul. Because crowds change quickly, often for no reason at all. 
        Values don't change - they evolve. 
        <br> <span class = 'bold'> Remember the ancients, sir. The people of history whose memories remain.</span>
        <br> Theirs are the characters to remember and admire and emulate. Just because things are accepted in this society of ours - doesn't mean the actions themselves are beneficial.
        <br> Is this what a Renaissance man is? Entrepreneurship, sport, language, family? Wow. 
        <br> Make your own path - with your own successes and failures and ideas and principles. Even though it's all a part of the whole. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        All models are wrong but some are useful.
        <br>  Go <span class = 'bold'> deep </span> on <span class = 'bold'> varied </span> fields.
        <br> The abilities to be bored, to focus, and to listen - are the three most important skills a person could have.
        <br> Having access to enjoyable things might not be as good as you think it is.
        <br> Work hard when you're young, but acknowledge your better years will probably come later. Why not increment through life, eh, flowing and that?
        <br> Don't you dare turn your life into Marvin's Room. It doesn't end well for anyone.
        <br> <span class = 'bold'> The images in your head aren't real. </span>
        <br> Never nourish a trigger. 
        <br> Nothing will ever be as cool as it seems. 
        <p>
            The internet is a cesspool of lies and fraudulent opinions and general shithousery. Watch yourself when you're on it. Use it for a purpose or not at all.
            <br> We're all fucked in our own ways.
            <br> To go true MonkMode, when you aren't hobbying or socialising - you must do literally fucking nothing. Sit down and be silent. Write down your thoughts and be mindful. This is the key to genius - solitude. This is what the people lack.
            <br> Fuck a nap unless it's powerful.
            <br> The 3 hobby theory - one to make you money, one to keep you in shape, one to keep you creative. This shit makes the modern-day reneissance man. 
            <br> Do things from a place of curiosity. This will make life enjoyable. 
            <br> Like Marcus said, fuck theorising about what makes a good man. Be one.
            <br> Never do something with the concern of how others will perceive you. Die as you are. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Boredom is a chance for unstructured meditation. Do it. 
            <br> You're more than a body. 
            <br> A system governed by energy will always look to be in the lowest-energy state possible - I.E; all you need to do is start doing something. From then, activate presence and deliberation and latter introspection. You're now good.
            <br> The Path is realising you're already in the process, sir. You don't need anything anymore. Just follow the path, and, you'll be well on your way. 
            <br>  <span class = 'italic'> What you do now will set you up well for later life. Not just financially. Physically. Mentally. Spirituality. </span> 
            <br> Digital comms must be kept to a minimum. Face-to-face prioritised.
        <br> Maybe you're not the only one in MonkMode... you gave it a name, but, people have been doing this for a long, long time. Men <span class = 'italic'> and </span> women.
