    <p class = 'intro'>
        <span class = 'bold'> Why the fuck not? </span>
        The crowd are cool but don't follow them. Follow your values - on this site and in your soul. Because crowds change quickly, often for no reason at all. 
        Values don't change - they evolve. 
        <br> <span class = 'bold'> Remember the ancients, sir. The people of history whose memories remain.</span>
        <br> Theirs are the characters to remember and admire and emulate. Just because things are accepted in this society of ours - doesn't mean the actions themselves are beneficial.
        <br> Is this what a Renaissance man is? Entrepreneurship, sport, language, family? Wow. 
        <br> Make your own path - with your own successes and failures and ideas and principles. Even though it's all a part of the whole. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        All models are wrong but some are useful.
        <br>  Go <span class = 'bold'> deep </span> on <span class = 'bold'> varied </span> fields.
        <br> The abilities to be bored, to focus, and to listen - are the three most important skills a person could have.
        <br> Having access to enjoyable things might not be as good as you think it is.
        <br> Work hard when you're young, but acknowledge your better years will probably come later. Why not increment through life, eh, flowing and that?
        <br> Don't you dare turn your life into Marvin's Room. It doesn't end well for anyone.
        <br> <span class = 'bold'> The images in your head aren't real. </span>
        <br> Never nourish a trigger. 
        <br> Nothing will ever be as cool as it seems. 
        <p>
            The internet is a cesspool of lies and fraudulent opinions and general shithousery. Watch yourself when you're on it. Use it for a purpose or not at all.
            <br> We're all fucked in our own ways.
            <br> To go true MonkMode, when you aren't hobbying or socialising - you must do literally fucking nothing. Sit down and be silent. Write down your thoughts and be mindful. This is the key to genius - solitude. This is what the people lack.
            <br> The 3 hobby theory - one to make you money, one to keep you in shape, one to keep you creative. This shit makes the modern-day reneissance man. 
            <br> Do things from a place of curiosity. This will make life enjoyable. 
            <br> Like Marcus said, fuck theorising about what makes a good man. Be one.
            <br> Never do something with the concern of how others will perceive you. Die as you are. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Boredom is a chance for unstructured meditation. Do it. 
            <br> You're more than a body. 
            <br> A system governed by energy will always look to be in the lowest-energy state possible - I.E; all you need to do is start doing something. From then, activate presence and deliberation and latter introspection. You're now good.
            <br> The Path is realising you're already in the process, sir. You don't need anything anymore. Just follow the path, and, you'll be well on your way. 
            <br>  <span class = 'italic'> What you do now will set you up well for later life. Not just financially. Physically. Mentally. Spirituality. </span> 
            <br> Digital comms must be kept to a minimum. Face-to-face prioritised.
        <br> Maybe you're not the only one in MonkMode... you gave it a name, but, people have been doing this for a long, long time. Men <span class = 'italic'> and </span> women.
        <br> <br> <span class = 'bold'> Young man! Look at how you live. </span> You see yourself to be a different kind of something and in doing so, fail to a greater extent than those whom you criticise. When you have found the path, your life will not be 'complete'. You will not 'find' anything of any kind. There will be no reward, no accolade, no fairytale ending. But what you do find, is something greater. You get a life. Not of the kind that other people tell you about, with sports or film or TV or celebrities or fast food or consumerism or hedonism or sex or drugs or drink or rock 'n roll or fame or status or accolade or anything else. While these things may come, you connect to something greater. To life itself. To the source, man. This is what they search for. 
        <br> The source, man. It's about becoming and brushing by the other ideas. About taking responsibility of mortality and building your corner of the universe well. In the process, you'll lose a lot. You might become unrelatable or have a hard time relating. You'll have criticism come your way. But that's all fine. It's about letting these small things slide, and being able to embrace the pain, whilst choosing to opt out of the suffering. This is what most don't see. 
        <br> To live well you must give up, not your efforts, but your expectations. This is the key.
        <br> Other's philosophies are all well and good but create your own and follow it. 
        <br> The answer to women is Zen. The answer to work is Zen. The answer to study is Zen. The answer to solitude is Zen. The answer to friendship is Zen. The answer to emotion is Zen. The answer to logic is Zen. The answer to question is Zen. The answer to answer is Zen. The answer to life is Zen. The answer to Zen is Zen. 
        <br> You go through a period of blind acceptance before questioning and then spiralling and then realising the absurdity before finally laughing along and accepting it is what it is, give it a crack, as best you can.
        </p>
        <p> 
          You've shut down your word document and run away as many times as anyone ever. You've gone to different fields with different ideas. But fuck it. Here you return. Who knows, kid. Maybe you're a writer.
