        There is no self. Anything with that word in it can easily be solved when you return to stillness. 
        <br> There are things you can control. There are things you can't. Control, however, is usually limited only to mind. This is fine.
        <br> For that which you can control - make a concentrated effort to do so. 
        <br> For that which you cannot control - accept. 
        <br> Whatever the case: never worry. It is an inefficient emotion. Allow the effort and the surrender to intertwine. This is what they mean when they tell you of the process. 
        <br> Seek to avoid inefficient emotions. But always remember love is never inefficient, despite what people may say. Without it, there is nothing worth anything. 
        <br> 
        <ul> <span class = "bold"> The Scrolls </span>
            <li> Meditations </li>
            <li> Tao Te Ching </li>
            <li> Camus Works </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p> 
        <br> From these scrolls you can find peace. Or at least, be reminded of such things. 
        <br> <br> Try to stick to things that are either time-tested or prototypical, with an emphasis on the former. 
        <br> Science doesn't have all the answers. Intuition can be incredible, when used correctly. 
        <br> As per the no-plan lifestyle, systems must accordingly be in place that allow for consistency and progression. 
        <br> This path of yours will probably be uncertain at times. You will feel negative emotions. This is to be expected, however. Without these elements you would be sure that death by boredom would be coming soon. 
        <br> Create a foundation for yourself to fall back on. Never fall for the survivorship bias of those in the media. Black Swan events will found the basis for your life, and while you look to optimise for the good, you must minimise risk from the bad. 
        <br> When all's said and done: go hard. Live hard, and well, and according to your rules. That way, whether you live, or die, you do by your own volition.
        <br> <br> The 80:20 rule is important. Double down on the things that act like investments. Negate that which is neutral or negative. It can also be a good attitude to risk, allowing for hormesis. 80% safe, vanilla; 20% risky, BDSM. 
        <br> The external is important, but the internals are everything. Flow. 
        <br> To be a man of the community you must only do things from stillness. Never for externals, like money or adulations.
        <br> Have a reverence for those that have done over those that have theorised. Theory is a derivation from practice, not the other way - and practice is refined and developed through systems of consistency. 
        <br> Always, in life, have a positive consistency. To be overly aimless in everyday life (not holiday), is to die a little bit. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class = 'italic'> Fashion, Money: You've all you need. Style is innessential. You can have it, but, ultimately, it forms self. What self? </span>
        <br> As for spending: look for investments. If it helps the craft, and you've spare; consider it. If it's an experience, consider it. If it's a thing - say no, almost always, unless replacing, but even then - go cheap as fuck, boy.
        <br> Look to create independent wealth. Not for luxury's sake, mind you. So that your family are set - and that their chosen struggles can be attacked with more vigour due to safety, like yours were. In addition, you must help the community. This is your duty.
    </p>
    <span class = 'bold'>
        Every action is more than what it seems. Things are never one-off. Things you do form habits. These will form the trajectory of your life. So, have good ones. Have good habits that translate to good days. Because years will pass and whatever you did that day, will either have multiplied or divided your eventual output. Yeah, you'll have bad days. But you can always get out of your own way, and flow towards the good. That's always an option. </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <br> Realise that perhaps the time for theory is past, now, and if it be so required, all the theory you need will remain at your bedside through the scrolls. Now is the time to do, sir. So do. Thought, is like a vaccine. The amount you need to thrive is slim. Too much will harm you. 
        <br> The time for drama is over, too. Become an uncomplicated man, at least to yourself. Others think what they will, that's outside of your control. But you, with yourself, be simple, honest, and forthright.
        <br> All of the things you hold most dear in your soul - mastery, love, fulfillment; will never be found through your own efforts. You cannot control these entities. All you can do is act and live in a way that is receptive to them. The rest is dependent on intangible factors so nuanced that to even consider them would be a waste of mental resources.
     </p>
