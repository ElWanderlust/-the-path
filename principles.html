    <p class = "intro">
        It's easy to talk about things that don't matter. Do things that don't matter. To think about stuff that doesn't matter, hasn't mattered, and will never matter. 
        <br> But you know what?
        <br> <i> Things don't have to be like this. </i>
    </p>

    <p id = "princplesTextExpansion">
        What if I told you that you could operate by a code?
        <br> A code; that may not make you the world's most popular, or richest, or most famous man - but one that would make you uniquely your own.
        <br> That's the code I've outlined below for you. 
        <br> <br> Maybe you'll wonder about all of the constraints and disciplines. Is it all necessary?
        <br> No. No, it isn't. This is all completely voluntary. And d'you know something else?
        <br> <span class = 'bold'> You are going to fail at this, probably a lot. But that's okay. </span>
        <br> <br> The goal is not to reach some end point of perfection. You're human. That was never an option to begin with. 
        <br> The goal, if we were to go by that vernacular, would be to stay on the path. 
        <br> To be honest - the path might even end up getting you wordly success. 
        <br> But that isn't the point. My final note - worldly success will come and go, but what the path will give you, is something greater, in my opinion. <span class = 'italic'> Peace.  </span> 
    </p>

    <p id = "theActualPrinciples">
        <ol id = "principia">
            <span class = 'italic'> Internal Principia </span>
            <li> Be here now. </li>
            <li> Optimise systems, never make a goal, nor a plan . Life isn't a checkbox. It's an experience.</li>
            <li> Judge no-one. In their position, you'd do similar; maybe worse. </li>
            <li> Preach to no-one but yourself. Don't offer advice unless asked. You don't know much, yourself.</li>
            <li> Always be learning. You don't need an institution to learn. </li>
            <li> Be grateful for all the blessings. How can you want, when you've already got it all? </li>
            <li> Operate from a foundation of kindness. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol id = "disciplines">
            <span class = 'italic'> Disciplines </span>
            <li> Train in martial arts, and the additional components of resistance. Study martial arts for an hour a week at a specified time, with notes.</li>
            <li> Train in meditation as you would for your body. Mind matters. And be wary of <span class = 'bold'> excitement</span>. Don't scorn it, but don't seek it either. Life is 90% boring, and that is beautiful - do nothing, whenever you're not doing hobbying or socialising. </li>
            <li> Have at least 2 periods per year of great immersion into writing. Document ideas into story. </li>
            <li> Learn about different technologies. Old, and new. </li>
            <li> Go to gatherings with people. Be a social creature, as best you can.</li>
            <li>Schedule - as time is important. Ensure daily doses of deep focus. Always do one thing at a time if it is possible. </li>
            <li> Increment your disciplines over time and improve. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol id = "negations">
            <span class = 'italic'> Negations </span>
            <li> Don't talk unnecessary shit. </li>
            <li> Don't do drugs, or drink more than 4X a year. </li>
            <li>  Eliminate daydreaming or word-music or visualisation. With your condition they are triggers. This world needs you more than the one in your head.</li>
            <li> NoPMO. Be mindful of short-term foolishness and sex. It's often a logistics issue.</li>
            <li> Eliminate toxicity in all its forms. If a man is not good or switched on don't keep him. That doesn't mean materially. That means with respect to codes.</li>
            <li> NoSurf - social media, youtube; the internet is a hammer, a tool - not to be played with. Never read op-eds or bullshit articles. Discard fast media. Minimise sport that isn't combat-related - as study of the martial should be given.</li>
            <li> Negate the concept of self internally, unless socially and conversationally. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol id = "commitments">
            <span class = 'italic'> Commitments </span>
            <li> Give back to causes throughout lifetime. Whether through donations, or your own foundations, try. </li>
            <li> Take what you need, and no more. Luxury is for the sake of others. Be frugal with yourself.</li>
            <li> Love your family and friends despite what they may think of you. </li>
            <li> Embody a man you'd be happy with your child knowing. </li>
            <li> See if you can be a force for inspiration through example. Small-scale, large-scale, whatever. Just live well.</li>
            <li> Never judge a man for hating you. Emotions are mirrors to souls.</li>
            <li> Try and ignore what the mainstream are doing. It's usually useless. </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
